<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Description
of the Quadrics addon</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This project contains a
Blender addon called Quadrics. This addon uses another addon called
Sverchok. So to enjoy Quadrics you first have to download and install
Blender and &nbsp;Sverchock. Please use a search engine, look for
Blender, download and install it. </p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Next you need to
understand how install a Blender addon. Please use a search engine,
look for Blender addon installation and learn how to install a Blender
addon. Basically first you need to download the addon. Addons usually
come as a .py or as a .zip file. Then you must go into Blender at
File&gt;User Prefernces&gt;Add-ons ("Add-ons" is a tab on the
user preferences page) and click on "Install from file". A file
selection dialog appears and you have to select the .zip or .py file
that contains the add on. Next, in the user preferences page, a line
with the addon name appears. On this line, on the right, you can notice
an empty check. Check it and the addon will be installed. Finally press
"Save User Settings" to make this installation permanent. See the
screenshot below for reference </div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 526px; height: 349px;" alt="Install addon" src="installaddoninfo.gif"></p>
<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install
&nbsp;Sverchok</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to take the
easiset, but not so complete, path you can skip the step below and do
not use these addons as Sverchock addons We advice you not to do this!
Sverchock is a great add on! Time spent to lean it will quickly return
in faster operations, graceful visual documentations of your ideas. Be
sure, using Sverchock will make your operations so easy! So,please, do
not skip this step or consider to follow this in a near future.
So, next, you need this, quile large, Blender addon called Sverchock.
Please use a search engine, look for Sverchock.<br>
At the time of writing this Wiki, looking for Sverchock, you will end
up in GitHub. At first, at least for me, it was unclear what to do with
that. Simply you have to PRESS DOWNLOAD ZIP and you will be prompted to
receive a zip file. </p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 525px; height: 187px;" alt="Install Sverchok" src="sverchokdownload.jpg"></h3>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take it to your hard disk
(or, hopefully, your SSD) and use it for the procedure described above,
to install Sverchock as a Blender add on. When process is over do not
forget to press "Save User Settings" in Blender user preferences add on
panel and the SHUT DOWN BLENDER to make all changes permanent.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">If you skip the
Sverchock installation, please, note that BEFORE installing Sverchock
and enjoy the BlendBridge addons in Sverchock you HAVE TO UNINSTALL all
the BlendBridge addons pressing the remove button in the Blender addon
user preferences panel </div>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 800px; height: 511px;" alt="remove" src="removebutton.jpg"><br>
</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then shutdown Blender,
install Sverchock, shutdown Blender, install each BlendBridge plugin.
By the way this is another good reason to start with Sverchock as soon
as possible.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally you can enjoy one
of these addons to create parametric surfaces. We advise you to go for
the <a class="" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/blendbridge/files/latest/download?source=files">Quadrics</a>
addon. So install the Quadrics.zip file, enable it, and the SAVE USER
PREFERENCES to make this installation permanent. <br>
The tiny Quadrics addon allows you to plot a (piece of) a (non
singular) quadric surface. The whole family of non singular quadrics
can be obtained changing the value of the three, non zero, parameters <math>sgnA2,
sgnB2, sgnC2</math>. The portion of the quadrics plotted is
controlled by the parameters Patch and by the Positive parameter.<br>
Patch control the extent of the surface plotted. Positive is relevant
only when the surface has two sheets. in this case the two sheets are
obtained cheking and unchecking the Positive box. Please note that if a
unique surface is needed there is a simple procedure, in Blender, to
tie the two sheets together into a single object. What you will get
will be a surface made up of two unconnected components. The output of
this plugin will be a triangulated mesh with vertices with x and y
ranging over a non uniform grid. The number of points in the grid will
be controlled by the parameter <math>Div</math>. The grid
will contain <math>Div</math><sup>2</sup>
points. The plotted surface will be the existing portion of the quadric</p>
